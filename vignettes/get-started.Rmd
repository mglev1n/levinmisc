# Populate a Project With Files/Folders Needed for Deploying a {targets} Project on LPC

This function populates a new project folder with the files/folders necessary for deploying a {targets} project on the LPC at Penn. This includes creating LSF templates, a "Pipelines.qmd" file containing boilerplate for running analyses, and a "Results.qmd" file which can be used to visualize the results.


<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->


```{r examples-populate_targets_proj}
#' \dontrun{
#' populate_targets_proj("test")
#' }
```

<!--
Here are some unit tests to verify the function works as expected.
-->


<!-- 

# Inflate your package
