# Populate a Project With Files/Folders Needed for Deploying a {targets} Project on LPC

This function populates a new project folder with the files/folders necessary for deploying a {targets} project on the LPC at Penn. This includes creating LSF templates, a `Pipelines.qmd` file containing boilerplate for running analyses, and a `Results.qmd` file which can be used to visualize the results.


<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->

This function creates several files/folders within the project directory. `.make-targets.sh` and `.clustermq_lsf.tmpl` are hidden helper files which a not designed for user interaction, but necessary for submission of jobs to the LSF scheduler:
  - `Pipeline.qmd` - Quarto markdown file which can be used to create a Target Markdown document that specifies a {targets} pipeline for your analyses. See: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/literate-programming.html#target-markdown for details. Remember to knit/render this document in order to generate the pipeline.
  
  - `Results.qmd` - Quarto markdown file which can be used to display the results generated by the {targets} pipeline specified in `Pipeline.qmd`
  
  - `build_logs/` - Directory where jobs logs are stored
  
  - `submit-targets.sh`- This is a bash script which can be used to run your {targets} pipeline, once `Pipeline.qmd` has been knit/rendered. This script can be run directly from the submission host. This script can accept command line options:
  
  
```
Usage: ./submit-targets.sh [-n NUM_CPUS] [-j JOB_NAME] [-o OUTPUT_LOG] [-e ERROR_LOG] [-q QUEUE] [-m MEMORY] [-s SLACK] [-h HELP]

Submit a job using the LSF scheduler with the specified number of CPUs and memory usage.

Options:
  -n NUM_CPUS    Number of CPUs to request for the job (default: 1)
  -j JOB_NAME    Name of the job (default: make_targets)
  -o OUTPUT_LOG  Path to the output log file (default: build_logs/targets_%J.out)
  -e ERROR_LOG   Path to the error log file (default: build_logs/targets_%J.err)
  -q QUEUE       Name of the queue to submit the job to (default: voltron_normal)
  -m MEMORY      Memory usage for the job in megabytes (default: 16000)
  -s SLACK       Enable slack notifications; requires setup using slackr::slack_setup() (default: false)
  -h HELP        Display this help message and exit
```

**Slack notifications**

Slack notifications of pipeline start/finish can be enabled using the `-s true` command line flag to the `./submit-targets.sh` script:

```
./submit-targets.sh -s true
```

Notifications are provided using the `slackr` package. The package must be configured before Slack notifications are enabled. See https://mrkaye97.github.io/slackr/index.html for more information about `slackr` setup and generation of an Slack API tocken
