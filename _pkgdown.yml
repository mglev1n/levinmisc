    Functions that are useful for performing colocalization.
    Colocalization is a technique for evaluating the evidence supporting the presence of shared causal variant(s) at a given locus across two or more traits.
    Several methods of colocalization have been described, which generally leverage GWAS summary statistics across multiple traits.
    The methods use either proportional or enumeration approaches, which make different assumptions and test different hypotheses.

  desc: >
    Functions that are useful for finemapping.
    Finemapping is an approach for identifying the putative causal variant(s) at a locus identified in a GWAS.
    Like colocalization, finemapping methods make different assumptions about the configuration of causal variant(s) at the locus.
